## Train Tracker: a Tool for Tracking Trains (TT:TTT)
An extremely simple practice program to check y use of objects, classes, accessor and mutator methods, and general ability to write code. however, it may be useful to a railway developer looking to trach which conductor is on which train, as well as details for said train. Running the program will create 2 trains and 2 conductors, one of each with and without the custom constructor. In order to use the code, the 'app' file must be edited to create the new train/constructor object.
